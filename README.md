Course materials for EPsy 8252


This GitHub repository is the home for the course _EPsy 8252: Methods in Data Analysis for Educational Research II_. It includes many of the materials used in the course.

## Downloading the Course Material

There are several methods to download the material from the GitHub site.

### Manual Download

To download all of the materials at this site, click on the `Download ZIP` button. This will download a ZIP file of the entire site on your local computer. 

To download individual files, you may need to click the filename, then click the ``View Raw`` link. At this point, the file may download, or you may need to right-click and do a "Save file as..." (If all else fails, re-download the entire folder using the `Download ZIP` button.)

### Automatic Download

Set up a GitHub account and then download the [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) GUI. Next, read the online help to learn how to clone the repository for this site. (Note that at this point, you are not contributing material to the site, you only need to clone the site on your local computer---do not worry about forking.)
