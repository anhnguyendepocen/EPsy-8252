BACKGROUND

The main outcome variable is the pupil popularity, a popularity rating on a scale of 1-10 derived by a sociometric procedure. Typically, a sociometric procedure asks all pupils in a class to rate all the other pupils, and then assigns the average received popularity rating to each pupil. Because of the sociometric procedure, group effects as apparent from higher level variance components are rather strong.
